The 3 projects :
A - Mini Calculatrice
1. Make a program that counts the 2 params and multiply them
2. Same thing as the 1st one, but with no number limit
3. Take as 1st args, the nature of the operations (if it's a *, a -, a / or a +)
<hr>
B - File stat
Take a file as a parameter and show the next things :
- The file weight
- The less used word (and it's quantity)
- The most used word (and it's quantity)
<hr>
C - Aspire contact
1. Make a program that take as parameter the name of 1 file. This file will contain a list or URL's
    -> Show the number of @ that are in the website (inside the HTML code)
2. Do the same thing, but with **multi-threading**, with Goroutines. (Like 1 Goroutine by URL)
BONUS : Your program will now show a list of found mails (in the alphabetic order) inside the URL, and finish with a list of found emails (See Regexp)
